- Uploaded Internet Explorer bash script, very simple and basic.

### OpenTabSafari
- To get things rolling you need to first allow permission for the bash file (.sh) to execute,
  - Open Terminal, run `chmod +x /path/to/OpenTabSafari.sh`
  - Then simply run it by `./OpenTabSafari.sh` and this should open a new Safari web page

### OpenTabIE
 - Open Command Prompt (Cmd), run `./OpenTabIE.sh` or simply run the code inside the bash script
 - (Not the best implementation, will be replaced!)
